# Amos Pivato . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Amos Pivato, and I am a Toronto Metropolitan University Computer Science graduate with experience working in Data science and automation.  I then discovered the world of AI and machine learning and decided that I wanted to leverage my skills with these tools to help build solutions that could help improve the way we live our everyday lives.  Since then, I've committed myself to always being open to learning anything I can and finding new ways to accomplish tasks more efficiently.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmosPivato/tree/master/linux_sql)]:
      
  - Implemented a Linux Cluster monitoring agent, using automated Bash commands, that retrieves and stores local network node hardware spec and usage data into a PSQL docker instance.
  - Designed the database table schemas for host info and host usage node data, and business problem queries that will provide information from this stored data within the RDBMS.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AmosPivato/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Implemented a Twitter CRD app that works with Twitters REST API to post, show or delete tweets, Springboot was used to handle app dependencies and to make sure all the apps layers functioned accordingly, and was then deployed through dockerhub as a docker image for easy distributions and execution..
  - JDBC App: Learned and implemented JDBC CRUD app using a test Database to use a DAO design pattern for easy application and database interactions.
  - Grep App: Implemented a GREP application using Maven in Java that could search for strings within a directories files using a matching regex pattern. Distributed over Dockerhub.
