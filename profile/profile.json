      "description": "Implemented a text adventure game with AI-driven NPC's using Python class functionalities.  Designed UML architecture and class diagrams to facilitate implementation within an agile team framework.  We developped the game's story and level to be interactable by the player and kept track of the games states using a JSON file.  User actions were taken from terminal inputed strings and parsed to then be sent into the game engine loop to changes states and progress the adventure.",

      "description": "Designed a level-driven 3d modeled tower shooter with textures in C++ using OpenGL libraries.  As a team, Models were implemented with a full hierarchical design for animation-driven gameplay using a life and points based gameply loop with a UI that displayed the game states.  Controls  were implemented using Keyboard and mouse event handlers, to allow for screen zooming, robot controls and game state reset's.",

      "description": "Designed, implemented, and tested two machine learning models to evaluate the accuracy of supervised learning Algorithms for movie recommendations in python.  Using the features from the Movielense Dataset, I decided to use the BPR, Bayesian personalized ratings pairwise loss, and the WARP, Weighted approximate rank pairwise loss, loss functions to conduct the learning regression steps for training the two approaches.  They were then tested against a testing set that was created beforehand using the same dataset  to check which model had higher results.",

I then discovered the world of AI and machine learning and decided that I wanted to leverage my skills with these tools to help build solutions that could help improve the way we live our everyday lives.  Since then, I've worked in Python, Java, and VBA to build automated reporting and information consolidating tools, as well as developed applications from the ground up.  All of this practice has allowed me to grow my skills and proficiencies even further and become a confident and reliable back-end developper."
