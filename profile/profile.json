      "description": "Implemented a text adventure game with AI-driven NPCs using Python class functionalities.  Designed UML architecture and class diagrams to facilitate implementation within an agile team framework.  We developed the game's story and level to be interactable by the player and kept track of the game's states using a JSON file.  User actions were taken from terminal input strings and parsed to then be sent into the game engine loop to change states and progress the adventure.",

As a team, Models were implemented with a full hierarchical design for animation-driven gameplay using life and points-based gameplay loop with a UI that displayed the game states.  Controls  were implemented using Keyboard and mouse event handlers, to allow for screen zooming, robot controls, and game state resets.",

      "description": "Designed, implemented, and tested two machine learning models to evaluate the accuracy of supervised learning Algorithms for movie recommendations in Python.  Using the features from the Movielense Dataset, I decided to use the BPR, Bayesian personalized ratings pairwise loss, and the WARP, Weighted approximate rank pairwise loss, loss functions to conduct the learning regression steps for training the two approaches.  They were then tested against a testing set that was created beforehand using the same dataset  to check which model had higher results.",

Springboot was used to handle app dependencies and to ensure all the app layers functioned accordingly when run from the CLI.   The app was then built using Maven and then deployed through Dockerhub as a Docker image for easy distribution and execution.",

Trader account details and quote details were persisted in the PSQL database using JDBC as the Datasource API.",

This allowed for the app to handle any HTTP request that the app's endpoints provided without needing to worry about andy state changes within the application.  Swagger was used to create an accessible UI for user and endpoint testing.",

I then discovered the world of AI and machine learning and decided that I wanted to leverage my skills with these tools to help build solutions that could help improve the way we live our everyday lives.  Since that day, I've worked in Python, Java, and VBA to develop automated reporting and information consolidating tools, such as automated budgeting tools and movie recommenders, to grow and progress my knowledge in AI and machine learning.  All of this practice has also allowed me to grow my skills, proficiencies, and experiences even further to become a confident and reliable back-end developer."
