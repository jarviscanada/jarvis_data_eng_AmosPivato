summary: My name is Amos Pivato, and I am a Toronto Metropolitan University Computer Science graduate with experience working in Data science and automation.  I then discovered the world of AI and machine learning and decided that I wanted to leverage my skills with these tools to help build solutions that could help improve the way we live our everyday lives.  Since then, I've committed myself to always being open to learning anything I can and finding new ways to accomplish tasks more efficiently.
